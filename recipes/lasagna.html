    <h3>Mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty</h3>
    <p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.<br> I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

            <li>Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.
